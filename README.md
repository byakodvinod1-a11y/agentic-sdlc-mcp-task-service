# Agentic SDLC Advanced Assignment

This repository implements the **Agentic SDLC Advanced Assignment** and contains the two required parts:

1. **Minimal MCP Server (Spring Boot + PostgreSQL)** for AI-powered task data injection  
2. **AgentGarage Workflow (n8n + Local LLM via Ollama)** for an SDLC automation use case

---

# 1. Assignment Goal

The objective of this project is to demonstrate an **AI-driven SDLC workflow** where:

- an **AI agent** can inspect a task schema,
- generate realistic task records,
- insert them through an MCP-compatible service,
- and validate the result in a PostgreSQL database.

In addition, the project includes an **AgentGarage / n8n workflow** that orchestrates the local LLM and the MCP service.

The MCP server is not part of the main business application flow.  
It acts as a **controlled AI-facing access layer** for schema inspection, data insertion, and summary retrieval.

# 5. MCP Task Service

## Objective

Build a minimal MCP-compatible service that allows an AI agent to:

- inspect the task schema,
- insert task records,
- retrieve summary statistics.

## MCP Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/mcp/help` | GET | Returns available MCP tools/endpoints |
| `/mcp/schema/tasks` | GET | Returns simplified task schema |
| `/mcp/tasks` | POST | Inserts task records |
| `/mcp/tasks/summary` | GET | Returns task statistics by status |

## Example MCP Calls

### Help
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/mcp/help
```

### Schema
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/mcp/schema/tasks
```

### Insert Tasks
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[{
    "title":"Example Task",
    "description":"Test task",
    "status":"OPEN",
    "priority":"MEDIUM",
    "dueDate":"2026-01-01"
  }]'
```

### Summary
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/mcp/tasks/summary
```

# 6. Database Schema

The `tasks` table includes:

- `id`
- `title`
- `description`
- `status`
- `priority`
- `due_date`
- `created_at`

## Allowed Status Values
- OPEN
- IN_PROGRESS
- DONE
- BLOCKED

## Allowed Priority Values
- LOW
- MEDIUM
- HIGH

# 7. How to Run the Project

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

- Java 17+
- Maven
- Docker / docker-compose
- Ollama
- n8n

---

## Step A — Start PostgreSQL

From the project root:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Verify container is running:

```bash
docker ps
```

---

## Step B — Run the MCP Service

Go to the Spring Boot project folder:

```bash
cd mcp-task-service
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The MCP service will be available at:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

---

## Step C — Verify MCP Service

Run:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/mcp/help
curl http://localhost:8080/mcp/schema/tasks
curl http://localhost:8080/mcp/tasks/summary
```

---

## Step D — Start Ollama

If Ollama is not already running:

```bash
ollama serve
```

Pull the model if needed:

```bash
ollama pull llama3.2
```

Verify:

```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
```

---

## Step E — Start n8n

If installed locally:

```bash
n8n
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:5678
```

# 8. n8n Agent Workflow

## Purpose

The n8n workflow acts as the **AI agent orchestrator**.  
It takes a webhook request, asks the local LLM to generate tasks, parses them, inserts them through MCP, and returns the final task summary.

## Workflow Steps

1. **Webhook** — receives request input  
2. **Create Batches** — creates batch instructions (`batchCount`, `batchSize`)  
3. **Generate Tasks with Ollama** — asks the local LLM for realistic tasks  
4. **Parse AI Tasks** — extracts valid JSON tasks from LLM output  
5. **Insert Tasks into MCP** — calls `/mcp/tasks`  
6. **Get MCP Summary** — calls `/mcp/tasks/summary`  
7. **Respond to Webhook** — returns final result

---

# 9. Example Agent Trigger

Once the webhook workflow is active, trigger it with:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5678/webhook/agent/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"batchCount":10,"batchSize":10}'
```

Example purpose:

- `batchCount = 10`
- `batchSize = 10`

Target generation:

```text
10 × 10 = 100 tasks
```

This request can be repeated or adjusted to reach the required dataset size.

---

# 10. AI Generation Strategy

The local LLM was used to generate **realistic SDLC-related task records**, such as:

- sprint planning
- bug fixing
- feature implementation
- testing
- validation
- code review
- deployment preparation
- documentation

The workflow performs:

- AI generation
- output parsing
- validation
- insertion through MCP
- summary verification

This ensures the generated data is not inserted blindly.

---

# 11. Validation and Final Result

The final dataset was validated using:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/mcp/tasks/summary
```

and direct database verification:

```bash
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U app -d taskdb -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tasks;"
```

## Final Result

- Total tasks created: **1000**
- Data stored successfully in PostgreSQL
- Inserted through MCP-compatible API
- Generated through AI-assisted workflow

Example final summary structure:

```json
{
  "specVersion":"2025-06-18",
  "tool":"mcp-tasks-summary",
  "total":1000,
  "byStatus":{
    "OPEN":346,
    "IN_PROGRESS":237,
    "DONE":199,
    "BLOCKED":218
  }
}
```
